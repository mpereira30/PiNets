Data is stored in .csv files in the following format:

row 1 - theta in radians (angular position of the inverted pendulum)
row 2 - theta-dot in radians/s (angular velocity of the inverted pendulum)
row 3 - control (torque applied to inverted pendulum)
row 4 - theta-double-dot  in radian/sec^2 (angular acceleration of the inverted pendulum)

Data is generated by DDP in receding horizon mode for swing up task of the inverted pendulum. 
Data consists of 50 such trajectories of MPC-DDP successfully performing swing up. The various trajectories are obtained by sampling initial angular position from [-pi,pi] and angular velocity from [-1,1] and fixed control time horizon of 30 steps for MPC. Discretization time step is 0.1
